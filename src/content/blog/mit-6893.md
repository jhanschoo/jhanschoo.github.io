I'm going through the reading list for Scott Aaronson's [_Philosophy and Theoretical Computer Science_](https://philtcs.wordpress.com/) course held at MIT in Fall 2011. Note that the course code is now used for a different topic. I have included links to the papers where available, but many of them have linkrotted. If you are interested, I have personal backups. I shall update this post with brief thoughts on the readings as I go through them.

> This new offering will examine the relevance of modern theoretical computer science to traditional questions in philosophy, and conversely, what philosophy can contribute to theoretical computer science.  Topics include: the status of the Church-Turing Thesis and its modern polynomial-time variants; quantum computing and the interpretation of quantum mechanics; complexity aspects of the strong-AI and free-will debates; complexity aspects of Darwinian evolution; the claim that "computation is physical"; the analog/digital distinction in computer science and physics; Kolmogorov complexity and the foundations of probability; computational learning theory and the problem of induction; bounded rationality and common knowledge; new notions of proof (probabilistic, interactive, zero-knowledge, quantum) and the nature of mathematical knowledge.  Intended for graduate students and advanced undergraduates in computer science, philosophy, mathematics, and physics.  Participation and discussion are an essential part of the course.
>
> **Prerequisites:** Previous coursework in either computability and complexity theory (such as 6.045 or 6.840) or analytic philosophy (such as 24.09)

## A. Turing, Computing Machinery and Intelligence (1950)

Here Turing introduces the _Turing test_ as a criterion for assenting to the question "Can machines think?" It is quaint to review this in the present milleu. Today, machines are indistinguishable from humans in restricted domains of discourse. Beyond, LLMs have the ability to hold a casual conversation to a similar ability as the lay person. After introducing the test, Turing anticipates objections and responds to them. Finally, he briefly presents the notion of learning machines. This is in response to a variant of Lovelace's objection that a machine can "never do anything new". He talks about how impoverished the signal of _punishments and rewards_ are with respect to learning a concept, and discusses Symbolic AI systems that logically build up new facts and conditional rules from a dataset of facts and conditional rules, and act on them. He discusses some element of randomization in which inferences to make. This is the interpretation Turing has here with respect to doing something new; that the system synthesizes new conditional rules and acts on them, beyond the data that it has been given. Personally, I find that the interpretation of "never do anything new" to ask for a machine that synthesizes from inputs to be a harder task that what the objection demands. Socially, we would consider another person to be "doing something new", or to "originate something", if we find that it is responding even simply to a part of the environment that we are not aware of. We are frequently happy with another human that learns from its environment but does not do too much synthesis on these inputs.

The discussion on the role of electricity in computers, as well as the anticipated objections, are very reflective of the milleu that Turing was writing in, and quite enjoyable to witness.

## L. Valiant, A Theory of the Learnable (1984)

This is the paper that introduced _PAC-learning_ (probably approximately correct learning). It is amusing that the focus of the paper is on the efficient _learnability_ of a particular class of concepts (boolean functions), rather than on the PAC-learning framework introduced to analyze it.

TODO(statement of PAC-learning, the particular learning machines discussed by Valiant) not-TODO(the particular complexity analysis that Valiant performs here)

## A. Wigderson, Knowledge, Creativity and $P$ versus $NP$ (April 2009)

Wigderson gives a lay introduction to $P$ and $NP$, informally characterizing $NP$ problem classes as problems for which solutions are difficult to find, but easy to verify. He uses [trunk packing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem) as a relatable example of an $NP$-complete problem. Near the end, he talks about cryptographic protocols being based on the hardness of $NP$ problems (in the guise of _one-way functions_ and _trapdoor functions_), as well as the notion of _zero-knowledge proofs_, which he has contributed seminal work on.

Wigderson here considers the heavily culturally loaded notion of creativity to be materially equivalent to the heavy computational work of finding solutions to $NP$-hard problems. I consider this identification to be quite naïve, and I suppose that Wigderson has a more respectable views than he lets on here, if not then, then perhaps since. But for a pop-sci discussion, I suppose it is acceptable. In particular, I don't think this characterization sufficiently appreciates the dialectic involved in doing empirical sciences or engineering. Here, material and communicative limitations dominate, and all the internal time and space resources gifted to an agent cannot save it from learning a wrong concept due to improper instrumentation. One must repeatedly query other entites and nature, and even then the inaccuracy of instrumentation limits the complexity of feasible concepts. Even with perfect instrumentation, for example, in the physical sciences, one immediately runs into computational intractability of the EXPTIME nature even in accurately simulating very "simple" molecular systems from first principles, so experimentation and querying the oracle of nature is fundamental to knowledge production.

Wigderson claims from intuition that "Every natural process can be viewed as computational". I suppose that one can in some manner say this, once one has demarcated for ourselves some phenomena corresponding to input and output, and the boundaries of the system that said process takes place. And still I suspect that the model of computation one would use to model such phenomena is very different from the models typically studied in computer science. In some sense, to the extent that we have microchips that do amazing computation, to that extent nature has the capacity to do so much computation in so little space. Our models, even physical models, are more reflective of human concerns than of any particularly impersonal and inhuman process.
